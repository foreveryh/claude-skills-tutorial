# Using Anthropics Skills for Consistent Brand Guidelines

Maintaining consistent brand guidelines, colors, and typography across all your marketing content can be time-consuming—especially when working with multiple team members or AI tools. Anthropics Skills solve this problem by encapsulating your brand expertise into a reusable package that Claude can apply automatically.

In this article, we'll focus on the **brand-guidelines** skill as a practical example of how to use Anthropics Skills to ensure every piece of content follows your brand standards.

## Anatomy of a Skill: The SKILL.md File

Every Anthropics Skill starts with a `SKILL.md` file—a simple markdown document with two key parts: **YAML frontmatter** for metadata and **markdown content** for instructions.

Let's examine the official `brand-guidelines` skill from the GitHub repository to see how this works:

### Frontmatter: Skill Metadata
```yaml
---
name: brand-guidelines
description: Applies Anthropic's official brand colors and typography to any sort of artifact that may benefit from having Anthropic's look-and-feel. Use it when brand colors or style guidelines, visual formatting, or company design standards apply.
license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt
---
```

This metadata tells Claude:
- `name`: A unique identifier for the skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- `description`: What the skill does and when to use it
- `license`: Legal terms for using the skill

### Content: Skill Instructions
The markdown content below the frontmatter provides Claude with the specific expertise it needs. For the `brand-guidelines` skill, this includes:

#### Core Brand Elements
The skill defines Anthropic's official color palette and typography rules:

**Main Colors:**
- Dark: `#141413` - Primary text and dark backgrounds
- Light: `#faf9f5` - Light backgrounds and text on dark
- Mid Gray: `#b0aea5` - Secondary elements
- Light Gray: `#e8e6dc` - Subtle backgrounds

**Accent Colors:**
- Orange: `#d97757` - Primary accent
- Blue: `#6a9bcc` - Secondary accent
- Green: `#788c5d` - Tertiary accent

**Typography:**
- **Headings**: Poppins (with Arial fallback)
- **Body Text**: Lora (with Georgia fallback)

#### Functional Features
The skill also includes rules for how these brand elements should be applied:

**Smart Font Application:**
- Applies Poppins font to headings (24pt and larger)
- Applies Lora font to body text
- Automatically falls back to Arial/Georgia if custom fonts unavailable
- Preserves readability across all systems

This combination of clear metadata and detailed instructions allows Claude to consistently apply Anthropic's brand identity to any document or artifact.

## Practical Use Cases for Brand Guidelines Skill

Here are some real-world scenarios where the `brand-guidelines` skill can streamline your marketing workflow:

### 1. Consistent Social Media Content
When creating social media posts, Claude can automatically apply:
- Your brand color palette to images and graphics
- The correct font hierarchy for headlines and body text
- Consistent tone and voice across all captions
- Brand-specific hashtags and call-to-action phrases

### 2. On-Brand Marketing Collateral
Generate brochures, flyers, and presentations that adhere to:
- Your company's typography rules
- Approved color combinations
- Layout guidelines (margin sizes, spacing, image placement)
- Brand messaging frameworks

### 3. Uniform Email Campaigns
Ensure every email follows your brand guidelines:
- Email template structure
- Header and footer design
- Button styles and colors
- Content formatting and tone

## How to Use the Brand Guidelines Skill

## Creating Your Own Custom Brand Guidelines Skill

While Anthropic provides an official brand-guidelines skill example, you can create a custom version for your organization:

1. **Use the template structure**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-company-brand-guidelines
   description: Applies My Company's brand colors, typography, and style guidelines to content.
   ---

   # My Company Brand Guidelines

   ## Color Palette
   - Primary: `#your-primary-color` - Main brand color
   - Secondary: `#your-secondary-color` - Supporting color
   - Accent: `#your-accent-color` - Call-to-action color

   ## Typography
   - Headings: Your Brand Font (fallback to Arial)
   - Body Text: Your Body Font (fallback to Georgia)

   ## Tone & Voice
   - Keep messaging friendly and approachable
   - Avoid jargon
   - Emphasize customer-centric language

   ## Layout Rules
   - Use 16px margin on all sides
   - Space between sections: 24px
   ```

2. **Focus on specificity**:
   - Include exact color codes
   - Define font families and sizes
   - Outline tone and voice guidelines
   - Add examples of do's and don'ts

With a custom brand guidelines skill, you can ensure every piece of content—whether created by Claude or your team—aligns perfectly with your brand identity.
