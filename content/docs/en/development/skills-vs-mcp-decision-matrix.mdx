Are you confused about the various tools in the Claude ecosystem — Skills, MCP, Subagents, Prompts, and Projects? Unsure when to use which tool? You're not alone. This is one of the most common questions in the Claude developer community.

This article provides a **detailed decision matrix** and **usage scenario guide** to help you make the right choice between different tools and avoid common pitfalls.

## Problem Background: The Paradox of Choice

Since Anthropic launched Claude Skills in October 2025, developers have faced a fortunate dilemma: too many tools, unsure which to use. Each tool has unique advantages, but overlapping use cases create decision-making difficulties.

According to the classification in the travisvn/awesome-claude-skills repository [1], we see:

- **150+ Community Skills**: Covering document processing, development testing, data analysis, creative media, and other fields
- **50+ MCP Servers**: Connecting external APIs and data sources
- **Multiple Frameworks**: Each with different strengths and optimization goals

## Core Concepts Quick Review

Before diving into the decision matrix, let's quickly review each tool's core characteristics:

### Claude Skills

**Definition**: Specialized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude dynamically discovers and loads when relevant.

**Progressive Disclosure Architecture** (consumes only ~100 tokens for scanning) [2]:
1. Metadata loading (100 tokens): Scan available Skills to identify relevant matches
2. Full instructions (&lt;5k tokens): Load when Claude determines the Skill applies
3. Bundled resources: Files and executable code load only as needed

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Definition**: Standard for enabling LLMs to interact with external services through tools, resources, and prompts.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **External Integration**: Connects to databases, APIs, services
- **Server-Based**: Requires running server process
- **Resource Access**: Provides access to external data sources
- **Tool Provision**: Exposes functions for LLM to call

### Subagents

**Definition**: Self-contained agents designed for specific purposes with independent workflows and restricted tool access.

**Core Features**:
- **Independent Operation**: Execute tasks autonomously
- **Specialized Tools**: Access to specific function sets
- **Workflow Isolation**: Separate from main conversation context
- **Permission Control**: Restricted access to specific capabilities

### Projects

**Definition**: Workspaces that maintain persistent background knowledge within specific contexts.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Context Persistence**: Maintains knowledge across sessions
- **File System Access**: Access to project files and directories
- **Session Isolation**: Separate environments for different projects
- **Long-term Memory**: Preserves information over time
