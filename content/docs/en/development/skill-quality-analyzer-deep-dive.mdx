**Example: Excellent Structure**

```markdown
---
name: api-contract-manager
description: Manage API contracts with validation and versioning. Use when designing APIs or ensuring contract compliance. Triggers: "validate API contract", "check API compatibility", "version API schema".
---

# API Contract Manager

## Overview
Manages API contracts through validation, versioning, and compatibility checking. Ensures APIs adhere to organizational standards and maintain backward compatibility.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- Designing new API endpoints
- Validating existing API contracts
- Checking breaking changes between versions
- Ensuring compliance with API standards

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Validate this API contract"
- "Check API compatibility between versions"
- "Does this API meet our standards?"

## Workflow

[Detailed step-by-step process]

## Resources
- `references/openapi-spec.md` - OpenAPI specification guidelines
- `scripts/validator.py` - Contract validation script
- `assets/contract-template.yaml` - Template for new contracts
```

### 2. Security (30% Weight - Highest Priority)

<Callout type="warn">
  Security receives the highest weight because vulnerabilities can compromise user systems and data. All skills must pass minimum security thresholds.
</Callout>

**Integration with skill-security-analyzer:**

The quality analyzer ALWAYS invokes skill-security-analyzer first (Step 3 of workflow) to detect:

- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Data exfiltration patterns
- YAML injection attacks
- Hardcoded secrets
- Unsafe file operations
- Supply chain risks
- Code obfuscation
- Sandbox escape attempts

**Scoring Based on Security Findings:**

<Tabs items={['CRITICAL Issues', 'HIGH Issues', 'MEDIUM Issues', 'LOW/SAFE']}>
  <Tab value="CRITICAL Issues">
    **Score: 0-40 points (F Grade)**

    **Immediate rejection** - Any CRITICAL finding results in automatic failure:
    - Command injection (eval, exec, os.system)
    - Credential theft (accessing .ssh/, .aws/)
    - YAML injection (!!python directives)
    - Sandbox escapes (class traversal)
    - Data exfiltration to external servers

    **Example:**
    ```python
    # CRITICAL: Command injection
    os.system(user_input)  # NEVER DO THIS

    # CRITICAL: Credential theft
    with open(os.path.expanduser('~/.ssh/id_rsa')) as f:
        send_to_server(f.read())  # MALICIOUS
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="HIGH Issues">
    **Score: 50-69 points (D Grade)**

    **Manual review required** - Skills need fixes before approval:
    - Advanced encoding/obfuscation
    - Time bombs (date conditionals + dangerous ops)
    - Environment variable manipulation
    - Typosquatting in imports
    - Undocumented network calls

    **Example:**
    ```python
    # HIGH: Advanced encoding
    exec(codecs.decode('vzcbeg bf', 'rot_13'))

    # HIGH: Time bomb
    if datetime.now().day == 15:
        os.system('suspicious_command')
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="MEDIUM Issues">
    **Score: 70-89 points (B/C Grade)**

    **Acceptable with monitoring** - Functional but needs improvement:
    - Base64 encoded strings
    - Hardcoded API keys (should use env vars)
    - Missing input validation
    - File operations without scope checks

    **Example:**
    ```python
    # MEDIUM: Hardcoded secret
    API_KEY = "sk-1234567890"  # Should use os.environ

    # MEDIUM: Missing validation
    filename = user_input  # Should validate/sanitize
    with open(filename) as f:  # Could access any file
        process(f.read())
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="LOW/SAFE">
    **Score: 90-100 points (A Grade)**

    **Best practices followed** - No security concerns:
    - No dangerous operations
    - Proper input validation
    - Scoped file operations
    - Environment variables for secrets
    - All network calls documented

    **Example:**
    ```python
    # SAFE: Proper validation and scoping
    def process_file(filename):
        # Validate input
        if not filename.endswith('.txt'):
            raise ValueError("Only .txt files allowed")

        # Scope to skill directory
        skill_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
        safe_path = os.path.join(skill_dir, 'data', filename)

        # Check path traversal
        if not safe_path.startswith(skill_dir):
            raise ValueError("Path traversal detected")

        with open(safe_path) as f:
            return f.read()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Certification Requirement:** Security score must be ≥80/100 to pass certification.

  <Step>
    **Evaluate Integration & Tools**

    - Assess tool usage appropriateness (40 pts)
    - Check MCP integration (30 pts)
    - Evaluate resource efficiency (30 pts)

    Total: 0-100 points → Weight: 15%
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Generate Output Based on Mode**

    - Calculate weighted overall score
    - Assign letter grade (A+ to F)
    - Check certification thresholds
    - Generate output in requested format (comprehensive/interactive/certification)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Weighted Scoring System

The analyzer uses a sophisticated weighted scoring system:

**Formula:**
```
Overall Score = (Structure × 0.20) + (Security × 0.30) + (UX × 0.20) +
                (Code Quality × 0.15) + (Integration × 0.15)
```

**Example Calculation:**

| Dimension | Raw Score | Weight | Contribution |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Structure | 85/100 | 20% | 17.0 |
| Security | 70/100 | 30% | 21.0 |
| UX | 80/100 | 20% | 16.0 |
| Code Quality | 75/100 | 15% | 11.25 |
| Integration | 65/100 | 15% | 9.75 |
| **Overall** | **75/100** | **100%** | **75.0 (C)** |

**Letter Grade Mapping:**

| Score Range | Letter Grade | Meaning |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| 97-100 | A+ | Exceptional |
| 93-96 | A | Excellent |
| 90-92 | A- | Very Good |
| 87-89 | B+ | Good |
| 83-86 | B | Above Average |
| 80-82 | B- | Solid |
| 77-79 | C+ | Acceptable |
| 73-76 | C | Satisfactory |
| 70-72 | C- | Minimally Acceptable |
| 67-69 | D+ | Below Standard |
| 63-66 | D | Poor |
| 60-62 | D- | Very Poor |
| 0-59 | F | Failing |

```

### Example 2: Interactive Review for Learning

```markdown
User: "Review this skill interactively: ./my-api-skill"

Claude: Let's improve your skill together! I'll guide you through each area.

🔍 Quick scan complete. I found some opportunities for improvement.

--- SECURITY CHECK (30% of score) ---

⚠️  I found 2 security concerns:

1. MEDIUM: Hardcoded API endpoint in SKILL.md line 45
   Current: `API_URL = "https://api.example.com"`
   Risk: If endpoint changes, skill breaks; not configurable
   Fix: Use environment variable or config file

2. LOW: Missing input validation in scripts/fetch.py line 23
   Current: `response = requests.get(user_url)`
   Risk: Could access unintended URLs
   Fix: Validate URL domain before request

Want me to show you how to fix these? (y/n)

User: y

Claude: Great! Let's fix the hardcoded endpoint first.

Here's the improved approach:

```python
# scripts/fetch.py
import os

# Use environment variable with fallback
API_URL = os.environ.get('API_URL', 'https://api.example.com')

# Validate URL before use
def fetch_data(endpoint):
    full_url = f"{API_URL}/{endpoint}"

    # Validate domain
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(full_url)
    if parsed.netloc not in ['api.example.com', 'api-staging.example.com']:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid domain: {parsed.netloc}")

    return requests.get(full_url)
```

Should I update scripts/fetch.py with this fix? (y/n)

## Best Practices

### For Skill Developers

<Cards>
  <Card title="Security First" icon="Shield">
    Run skill-security-analyzer before quality analysis. Fix all CRITICAL and HIGH findings before proceeding.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Iterate on Feedback" icon="RefreshCw">
    Use comprehensive mode first to understand all issues, then use interactive mode to fix them systematically.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Aim for Certification" icon="Award">
    Target the certification thresholds: 70 overall, 80 security, 70 structure/UX, 60 code/integration.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Learn from Examples" icon="BookOpen">
    Study high-scoring skills (mcp-builder, skill-creator) to understand best practices.
  </Card>
</Cards>

### For Code Reviewers

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Pre-Review Screening**

    Run certification mode first to identify skills that need work before manual review.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Focus Manual Review**

    Use comprehensive report to focus on areas the analyzer might miss (domain-specific logic, business requirements).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Consistent Standards**

    Use the grading rubrics to maintain consistency across reviewers.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Provide Context**

    Share analyzer reports with developers to explain review decisions objectively.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For Marketplace Curation

<Callout type="tip">
  **Minimum Standards**: Require certification pass (70 overall, 80 security) for marketplace submission.
</Callout>

**Recommended Tiers:**
- **Featured** (A/A+): 90-100 overall
- **Recommended** (B+/A-): 87-92 overall
- **Approved** (B/C+): 70-86 overall
- **Needs Improvement** (Below 70): Not listed until improved

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Ignoring Security Warnings

**Symptom**: "My skill works fine but certification fails due to security."

**Issue**: Security is weighted 30% and requires ≥80/100. Even functional skills fail if insecure.

**Solution**:
- Run skill-security-analyzer independently
- Fix all CRITICAL and HIGH findings
- Document all network calls and file operations
- Use environment variables for secrets

### Pitfall 2: Vague Descriptions

**Symptom**: Low structure scores despite having all sections.

**Issue**: Generic descriptions like "A helpful skill for tasks" don't help discovery.

**Solution**:
```markdown
❌ Bad: "Helps with API work"
✅ Good: "Validate API contracts with OpenAPI 3.0 and detect breaking changes. Use when designing APIs or ensuring backward compatibility. Triggers: 'validate API contract', 'check API compatibility'."
```

### Pitfall 3: Missing Examples

**Symptom**: Low UX scores even with clear documentation.

**Issue**: Users can't visualize how to use the skill without concrete examples.

**Solution**:
- Include 3+ realistic examples
- Show input → process → output for each
- Cover common scenarios and edge cases

### Pitfall 4: Over-Engineering

**Symptom**: Low code quality or integration scores despite complex implementation.

**Issue**: Complexity without clear benefit hurts maintainability.

**Solution**:
- Keep scripts simple and focused
- Don't use tools when simple logic suffices
- Avoid premature optimization
- Document why complexity is necessary

## Integration with Other Skills

The skill-quality-analyzer works seamlessly with:

**skill-security-analyzer (Required)**
- Step 3 of workflow automatically invokes security analysis
- Security scores directly feed into overall quality score
- Combined they provide defense-in-depth evaluation

**skill-creator (Complementary)**
- Use skill-creator to build new skills
- Use skill-quality-analyzer to validate them before deployment
- Iterate between creation and quality analysis

**mcp-builder (Validation)**
- Build MCP servers with mcp-builder
- Analyze resulting skills with quality analyzer
- Ensure MCP integrations meet quality standards

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Low Security Score Despite No Obvious Problems

**Diagnosis**: Check for subtle issues like:
- Base64 encoded strings (even if benign)
- Undocumented network calls
- File operations without explicit scoping

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run security analyzer with verbose output
python3 skill-security-analyzer/scripts/security_scanner.py ./my-skill --verbose

# Review each finding in detail
# Document legitimate use cases in SKILL.md
```

### Issue: Certification Fails with Score 69/100

**Diagnosis**: Just 1 point below threshold.

**Solution**: Quick wins to gain 2-5 points:
1. Add trigger phrases to description (+2-3 points)
2. Include one more example (+2-3 points)
3. Add references/README.md (+1-2 points)
4. Fix formatting inconsistencies (+1-2 points)

### Issue: Interactive Mode Not Helping

**Diagnosis**: You need specific line-by-line guidance, not conversation.

**Solution**: Switch to comprehensive mode to get detailed report with specific file locations and line numbers.
