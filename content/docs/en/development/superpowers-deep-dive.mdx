3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code structure while maintaining test coverage

**Key Features**:
- Automated test discovery and generation
- Intelligent test organization and naming
- Integration with popular testing frameworks
- Continuous test execution feedback
- Test coverage analysis and improvement suggestions

**Practical Example**:
```bash
/superpowers:brainstorm "User authentication system"
# Generates comprehensive test scenarios

/superpowers:write-plan "Implement OAuth2 authentication"
# Creates detailed implementation plan with test cases

/superpowers:execute-plan
# Executes plan with continuous TDD cycle
```
